This plugin integrates the LanguageTool grammar checker into Vim.
Current version of LanguageTool can check grammar in many languages
See the list of supported languages: http://www.languagetool.org/languages/
or http://www.languagetool.org/ or more information about LanguageTool.

The script defines 2 commands:

* Use  :LanguageToolCheck  to check grammar in current buffer.
  This will check for grammar mistakes in text of current buffer
  and highlight the errors. It also opens a new scratch window with the
  list of grammar errors with further explanations for each error.
  Pressing <Enter> in scratch buffer will jump to that error. The
  location list for the buffer being checked is also populated.
  So you can use location commands such as :lopen to open the location
  list window, :lne to jump to the next error, etc.

* Use  :LanguageToolClear  to remove highlighting of grammar mistakes,
  close the scratch window containing the list of errors, clear and
  close the location list.

Bugs:  
  Column number reported by LanguageTool indicating the location of the 
  error is sometimes incorrect. There is an opened ticket about this bug: 
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3054895&group_id=110216&atid=655717 
  The script currently works around it by doing pattern matching with  
  information context but it is not a perfect workaround: it can cause 
  spurious highlighting of errors in rare cases. This bug is fixed in
  LanguageTool-1.8.
