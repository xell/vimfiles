This plugin tries to duplicate the functionality of Marc Weber's 
outline.vim (vimscript #1947) on the basis of its description and of 
vim's own |:g|. Other than outline.vim, it relies on tlib (vimscript 
#1863).

The TToC command can be used to get a quick table of contents of the 
buffer based on a given regular expression. The regexp can be defined on 
the command line, in window (w:ttoc_rx), buffer-local (b:ttoc_rx) 
variables or in global filetype-specific (g:ttoc_rx_{&filetype}) 
variables. The order actually is: [wbg]:ttoc_rx_{&filetype} > 
[wbg]:ttoc_rx.

In the list view, you can select a line and either preview it (<c-p>), 
jump there (<), close the list and jump there (<cr>).

Example: >

  " Use the default settings for the current file-type
  :TToC
  " Show all words beginning at column 1
  :TToC ^\w
  " Show 'if' statements (but not the concluding 'then' statement)
  :TToC ^\s*if\>.\{-}\ze\s\+then
  " Show 'if' statements and 3 extra lines
  :3TToC! \<if\>

The TToC with a bang works somewhat like |:g| only that you can 
browse/filter the list and select an item after reviewing the results. 
Try it out and compare (with the help file as current buffer): >

  :TToC! TToC

with >

  :g/TToC
