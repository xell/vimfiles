This script provides a simple and fast way to see the difference between two blocks of text.
This might be similar source code functions, definitions, etc.

Just select the first portion, goto Menu "Tools->BlockDiff->This is block 1".
Select the second portion, goto Menu "Tools->BlockDiff->This is block 2, start diff".
The script will open a new tab, split it and diff the two portions.

If you prefer the mouse context-menu, a key mapping or ex commands, they all are prepared in the file, just remove the comment and/or change the mappings.

Currently only for Vim 7.* with GUI (and tabs).
