This plug-in provides filtering/search functionality to Vim, similar to e.g.
PSPad. This plug-in offers a number of additional features:

- Further filtering/searching inside the filtered results.
- Syntaxt highlighting in the filtered results.
- Show context line around found matches. You can dynamically change the number
  of lines.
- Easy jumping to and from the filter buffers, including auto-follow.

In addition, the new 2.0 version (currently work in progress!) offers:
- Fine-tuning of results (AND, OR and AND-NOT)
- Showing context lines above, below or above and below the matches.
- Show the raw results (no line numbering) for easy yanking.

The search results are presented in a separate buffer (and window) and the
script offers a number of convenience key-mappings to navigate from one result
to the next.

There are no default mapping to start the plug-in, but setting this up can be
as easy as cut-n-paste from the help file. In the results buffer a number of
mappings are set up, please refer to the help file for an overview in 2.0. For
older releases, press ?. Since ? is a useful VIM command it's no longer mapped
in 1.0.7. In a results window, type ":call ShowHelp()" and press enter.
