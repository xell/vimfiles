This is a handy plugin that makes easy replacing your favorite pattern ("@" by default) with a sequence of incremented values using the "Inc" command.

Examples:

If you have a file that only contains the following lines:

   This is line @
   This is line @
   This is line @
   This is line @

By typing ":1,4Inc", you obtain:

   This is line 0
   This is line 1
   This is line 2
   This is line 3

Better yet...  With ":Inc i11 s4 pblah",

   This is a list: [blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah]

becomes

   This is a list: [4, 15, 26, 37, 48, 59, 70]

You can also repeat the same value several times.  Consider:

   case
      addr@: begin value@ = offset@+incr@; end
      addr@: begin value@ = offset@+incr@; end
      addr@: begin value@ = offset@+incr@; end
   end

After ":%Inc r4", you obtain:

   case
      addr0: begin value0 = offset0+incr0; end
      addr1: begin value1 = offset1+incr1; end
      addr2: begin value2 = offset2+incr2; end
   end

I have just added support for bases and right alignment.  You just have to specify the width of your alignment:

   `define MEM_ADD0 @
   `define MEM_ADD1 @
   `define MEM_ADD2 @
   `define MEM_ADD3 @

becomes, after running ":%Inc w3 i128 f0":

   `define MEM_ADD0 000
   `define MEM_ADD1 128
   `define MEM_ADD2 256
   `define MEM_ADD3 384

or, after running ":%Inc w3 i128 f0 h":

   `define MEM_ADD0 000
   `define MEM_ADD1 080
   `define MEM_ADD2 100
   `define MEM_ADD3 180

Many thanks to Stanislas Sitar (vimscript #145), Ely Schoenfeld (vimscript #1199), Charles E Campbell's (vimtip #150, vimscript #670) and Neil Bird (vimscript #189).

Note: I need to merge with Ely's version, and to update the documentation.  Sorry if this causes any inconvenience in the meantime.

Happy Vimming!
